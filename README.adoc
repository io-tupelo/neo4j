= Neo4J Demo in Clojure

A simple demo accessing Neo4J using the `gorillalabs/neo4j-clj` library.

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== Installation

This project assumes you have already installed Neo4J Desktop (Enterprise Edition). It is available
for free for local use.  When you download the installer, be sure to copy the Activition Code and
save it.  You will need the Activation Code during the installation process.

Since the Neo4J Desktop is free to use for development, I have not played around with the
open source Docker version of Neo4J.

== Environment

The unit tests in this repo work against a locally running instance of Neo4j Desktop.  For some
unknown reason, it doesn't work right running against a basic DB in the Neo4j Aura cloud.

== Configuration after installation

Note that in the Neo4j Desktop browser, there are three (3) different entities to consider:

1. the Project
2. the DBMS
3. the DB

Keep in mind that a project can have multiple DBMS's, and a DBMS can have multiple DB's.

For our purposes, create the following configuration in Neo4j Desktop:

- Click the top-left "project" icon, then the `+ New` button to create a new project. Name it 
  "Demo Project", for example.

- In the top-right corner, click the "+ Add" button to add a "Local DBMS".  Change the default name
  to "Unit Test DBMS", if desired.  For development purposes, set the password to "secret". Then,
  click the blue "Create" button.  

- Click on the DBMS name under the Project name in the Neo4j Desktop window to highlight it, then
  click on the "Plugins" tab in the RHS panel. Select "APOC" and install to the DB.

- Click on the DBMS name under the Project name in the Neo4j Desktop window to highlight it, then
  click the green "Start" button so the DB is active (not just the neo4j desktop).  If you make any
  changes to the DB config you'll need to click the "restart" to make then take effect.

- The DBMS will create 2 DB's, "system" and "neo4j". We accept the default DB name "neo4j" in the
  DBMS.  If you click the "Details" tab on the RHS panel, you should see the Bolt protocol running
  on port 7687.

- We depend on the DB name "neo4j", the password "secret", and the port 7687 being correct. 
  These creds must be correct or the neo4j driver can't connect to the DB (it will fail auth).

== Credentials Configuration

This code uses the `lein-environ` plugin to access your database credentials from 
a file `profiles.clj` which you should **never check into SCM/git**.
After using `git clone` to copy this repo to your local machine, execute:

    > cp profiles-template.clj profiles.clj     # copy template file to actual file

Then, in `profiles.clj`, replace the placeholders `XXXXX` and `YYYYY` 
with the actual values for your `username` and `password`.

For local development & testing with Neo4j Desktop (preferred), you may also use
the pre-configured profile:

    > cp profiles-localhost.clj profiles.clj     # copy profile for local DB

It is setup correctly for use with the default DB name `neo4j` and the "starter password" of
`secret`.


== Run the Unit Tests

I do this so much I have some bash aliases:

```bash
alias lct=" time (lein do clean, test)"
alias lctr="time (lein do clean, test-refresh)"
```

The first one `lct` is generic, the 2nd one `lctr` is for use with the lein-test-refresh plugin.

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

Just type

```bash
> lct   # or `lein clean ; lein test`
```

with result:

```pre
  -----------------------------------
     Clojure 1.10.3    Java 15.0.2
  -----------------------------------

  lein test tst.demo.core
  Creating session...
  Getting Neo4j version info
  Getting APOC version info
    *** APOC not installed ***

  Ran 2 tests containing 4 assertions.
  0 failures, 0 errors.
  ( lein do clean, test; )  30.19s user 0.87s system 320% cpu 9.698 total
```

The message "*** APOC not installed ***" shows that we have not installed the free APOC library of
functions for Neo4J.
We want to install APOC. The APOC library is free and very useful, so we normally want to have it available.

=== Install the APOC library

In the Neo4j Desktop window, highlight your project in the left-hand
nav pane..  Then click near the green "ACTIVE" label, which will open the "Manage" screen on the RHS of the screen.
Click on Plugins -> APOC -> Install and Restart.  After the DB has restarted, re-run the tests.

```pre
  > lct

  lein test _bootstrap

Notice that this time it found the APOC library.

== Code Structure

All interesting code is in the NS `tst.demo.core`, under the `test` directory.  I like this naming structure better then
the `-test` suffix as it doesn't mess with the filename, and there is no conflict between hyphens "core-test"
vs underscores "core_test.clj".

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.
